                    Our Origins
                </h1>
                <p><b>OHM SYSTEMS established 1980 as an Ohio Corporation.</b>
                    During the early 80’s, OHM provided by project state of the art programs to meet individual
                    manufacturing client needs. Seeing how many of the features and functionalities could be
                    standardized,
                    OHM undertook development of their own 4GL toolset OHMTools™. Upon the completion of these tools OHM
                    was
                    able to quickly generate robust features and functionality of integrated modules to meet the full
                    Enterprise wide requirements of Discrete, Repetitive, Assembly, JIT, Mix Mode and Job Shop
                    environments.<br /><br />

                    In fact the OHMTools™ were so successful in their ability to generate and design using minimal code
                    to
                    accomplish major programming efforts, OHMTools™ became a standalone product used by many other
                    developers and application development projects.
                    OHM continues to add to their module suite of products, which now includes 33 different and
                    integratable
                    modules as well as extension modules to meet the specific needs of niche industries such as
                    government,
                    aerospace and bedding manufacturing.<br /><br />

                    While OHM continues to grow they remain the leaders in “bleeding” edge technologies. OHM was one of
                    the
                    first integrated manufacturing packages in the early 90’s to migrate to the NT platform. Currently
                    with
                    OHM’s release of the OHMWeb™ toolset and OHMWeb™ Manufacturing MRP/ERP application they have
                    superceded
                    the claimed advancements of other competing packages. OHM is not a web “enabled” product but a true
                    web-based product. The ability to provide real time field level validation on a web page and
                    multiple
                    criteria search with the greatest of speed are just a few of the superior features offered by the
                    products.<br /><br />

                    OHM is a full service application provider headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio with an International
                    R&D
                    center in Bangalore, India DBA Softline Systems Pvt Ltd.<br /><br />

                    The OHM staff consists of highly qualified professionals with backgrounds and education in
                    manufacturing. OHM believes in more than just having a solid application; it is also necessary to
                    have
                    the personnel who understand business needs. OHM provides services to first understand your business
                    requirements and then to utilize the OHM applications to meet those needs.</p>
