                                system
                                allowed you to do it. We look at steps and processes and help you to plan and identify
                                your
                                day to day business practices so that the installation of a new application can be
                                installed
                                using your policies and practices. We also decide with you on the best way to migrate
                                your
                                existing data and/or what is applicable to be rekeyed. We review areas of data that need

                                be addressed prior to the implementation. We make recommendations to the level of
